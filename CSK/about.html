Founded in 2008, the team plays its home matches at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. The team is owned by India Cements through its Chennai Super Kings Cricket Limited holding company. They have won a record five IPL titles (shared with Mumbai Indians), appeared in a record 10 finals and have qualified for the playoff stages 12 times out of the 14 seasons they have played, more than any other team. The team is currently captained by Ruturaj Gaikwad after MS Dhoni stepped down in 2024. They are currently coached by Stephen Fleming. In January 2022, CSK became India's first unicorn sports enterprise.

         team was suspended for two years from the IPL starting July 2015 due to the involvement of its owners in the 2013 IPL betting case, and won the title in its comeback season of 2018. In addition, they have also won the Champions League Twenty20 in 2010 and 2014. They are the second most valuable IPL franchise with a valuation of roughly $1.15 billion as of 2022.</p>
